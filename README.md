So far i've added randomly spawning zombies, player movement, gun shooting and recoil. Trying to work on a health system for zombies and the player, scoring, stabilizng the FPS better and
sprites. Also was thinking of adding a "gun game" sort of mode, where every time you kill a zombie (or multiple in quick succession), you get a better gun.
