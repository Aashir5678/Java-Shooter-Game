So far i've added randomly spawning zombies, player movement, gun shooting, [dead eye](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Eye_Targeting) (almost) and recoil. Trying to work on a health system for zombies and the player, scoring, stabilizng the FPS better, sprites and finishing off the dead eye mechanic. Also was thinking of adding a "gun game" sort of mode, where every time you kill a zombie (or multiple in quick succession), you get a better gun.
